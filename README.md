# README for Business Scenario Simulator (Java Desktop Application)

---

## üìù Project Overview

**Business Scenario Simulator** is a simple interactive Java desktop application that allows Business Analysts (or anyone) to:

- Simulate business scenarios over multiple years.
- Input key business parameters: investment, demand growth, cost growth, risk factor, and number of years.
- See year-by-year calculations of revenue, cost, and profit.
- Analyze potential business outcomes under varying risk conditions.

## üñ•Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Java (SE 8+)
- Swing (for GUI)
- Randomized simulation model
- No external libraries required

---

## üìÇ Project Structure

```
BusinessScenarioSimulator.java  # Complete Java source code
```

---

## üîß Prerequisites

- Java JDK 8 or higher installed on your system.
- Verify installation:

```bash
java -version
```

---

## üöÄ How to Compile and Run

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Download the file

Save `BusinessScenarioSimulator.java` to any folder.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Open terminal (or Command Prompt on Windows) and navigate to the folder:

```bash
cd path/to/your/folder
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Compile the Java code:

```bash
javac BusinessScenarioSimulator.java
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Run the application:

```bash
java BusinessScenarioSimulator
```

‚úÖ The GUI window will open for input and simulation.

## üî¨ How It Works

- Starts with initial investment amount.
- Calculates initial revenue (80% of investment) and cost (50% of investment).
- For each year, revenue and cost grow according to:
  - **Demand growth** (% per year)
  - **Cost growth** (% per year)
  - **Risk factor** (% random fluctuation per year)
- Calculates profit for each year: `Profit = Revenue - Cost`.
- Displays the results in a simple table inside the application.

## ‚ö† Challenges and Limitations

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Simplistic Business Model
- The simulation logic is intentionally simple for demonstration purposes.
- In real-world business scenarios, models are far more complex (multivariate, non-linear, market-dependent).

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Randomized Risk Factor
- Random fluctuation simulates market uncertainty but is not statistically rigorous.
- More sophisticated risk modeling could improve realism.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ No Persistence or Export
- The app does not save scenarios or export results.
- Export to CSV/Excel could be added for deeper analysis.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ No Visualization
- No built-in charts or graphs. 
- Adding simple line charts would greatly improve analysis.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ No External Data Integration
- Simulation relies solely on user input.
- Real datasets (historical sales, market trends, etc.) could improve modeling.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Not Web-Based
- Fully desktop-based; no web or cloud version.
- Could be extended to web-based application for collaborative scenario modeling.

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Error Handling is Basic
- Minimal input validation.
- Could improve with more user-friendly error prompts.

## üîÆ Possible Extensions

- Add real-time charts using JFreeChart or similar libraries.
- Allow saving/loading scenarios.
- Export results to CSV/Excel.
- Support multiple scenarios for comparison.
- Add forecasting algorithms.
- Add scenario templates for different industries.
- Build full web version (Spring Boot, REST API, frontend dashboard).
